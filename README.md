# StateMachine
An exercise in implementing a full-featured state machine framework in python.
No GUI intended, but the user will configure the machine by adding states, events, actions & transitions, 
then run the machine against an event generator. Output will also be in the form of a generator allowing
the use of a for loop to process results.
